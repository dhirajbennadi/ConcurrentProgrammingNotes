# Coherence

# Memory Consistency
Memory consistency defines how accesses to different locations interleave
Coherence deals with only single location

Sequentially consistent atomic accesses are globally, totally ordered amongst themselves

Every atomic access is globally, totally ordered
Non-atomic accesses are ordered between the atomic accesses

# Peterson Algorithm

# Atomic Operations


# Sequential Consistency

# Locks
1. TAS - Issues Contention
2. TTAS

Both the above locks function as LIFO which results in massive unfairness between threads
